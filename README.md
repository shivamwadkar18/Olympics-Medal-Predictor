# Olympics-Medal-Predictor
# This repository contains an Olympic Medal Predictor, a machine learning project leveraging regression models to predict the number of medals a country might win based on its performance in previous years. The model incorporates historical medal data and highlights an important observation: countries that send more athletes tend to have predictions that are closer to actual outcomes, while countries with fewer athletes exhibit greater prediction errors. This project showcases how data trends and participation levels can influence predictive accuracy, providing insights into sports analytics and performance forecasting.
